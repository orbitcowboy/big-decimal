I started this project from an interest in approximating pi.  I decided the most straight forward way of doing this was to use mathematical formulas which would require a high degree of accuracy for a number class.  The class supports most of the basic operations (+,-,`*`,/) though the code is rather messy since I started this while I was learning C++.  It's a work in progress and can definitely be optimized.  The biggest accomplishment I've gotten from it so far was approximating pi to 10,000 places which took two weeks.  I realize that it is a horribly inefficient way of creating a arbitraty precision class, but hey, it works (as far as I've tested it anyway).  I also started a rational number class (Fraction) based on the big decimal class (DEC).
